# MultiDB-SpringBoot-Integration
Welcome to the MultiDB-SpringBoot-Integration repository! This project serves as a comprehensive guide and implementation example on integrating multiple databases within a single Spring Boot application.

2 Databases or 2 Datasource to connect with one Service:
3 major things we need to take care of:
1) Define the data sources we want to interact
2) Entity Manager we need to define along with some properties.
3) Transactional Manager we need to define all types of queries
